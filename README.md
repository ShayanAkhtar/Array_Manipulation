## Array Operations Program

This program allows you to perform various operations on an array. It provides options for creating an array, inserting elements, deleting elements, updating elements, swapping elements, displaying the array, copying elements, finding elements, and deleting the entire array.

### How to Use

1. Run the program and enter the size of the array.
2. Choose an operation from the menu options:
   - **Create Array:** If the array is not already created, you can enter values for each element of the array.
   - **Insertion:** Choose from options to insert an element at the start, end, or a specific index of the array.
   - **Deletion:** Choose from options to delete an element from the start, end, or a specific index of the array.
   - **Update:** Update an element in the array by providing the index or value.
   - **Swapping:** Swap elements in the array either by index or value.
   - **Display:** Display the current state of the array.
   - **Copy:** Copy an element from one location to another in the array.
   - **Find:** Search for a specific value in the array and get the indices where it is found.
   - **Delete Entire Array:** Delete all elements of the array.
   - **Exit:** Terminate the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts and enter the required information for each operation.

### Program Functions

- `Enter_array`: Allows you to enter values for each element of the array.
- `Show_array`: Displays the elements of the array along with its size.
- `Disp_array`: Displays the elements of the array in a formatted manner.
- `Insert_start`: Inserts an element at the start of the array.
- `Insert_end`: Inserts an element at the end of the array.
- `Insert_specific`: Inserts an element at a specific index in the array.
- `Delete_start`: Deletes the first element of the array.
- `Delete_end`: Deletes the last element of the array.
- `Delete_specific`: Deletes an element at a specific index in the array.
- `Update_location`: Updates an element in the array by providing the index.
- `Update_value`: Updates an element in the array by providing the value.
- `Swap_value`: Swaps elements in the array by value.
- `Swap_index`: Swaps elements in the array by index.
- `Copy_index`: Copies an element from one location to another in the array.
- `Find`: Searches for a specific value in the array and returns the indices where it is found.

### Important Note

- The program does not perform any input validation or error handling, so make sure to enter valid inputs.
- Before performing any operation, ensure that the array has been created (option 1).
- Take care while deleting or updating elements, as the program directly modifies the array.
- Make sure to select the appropriate option for swapping elements based on index or value.

Please note that this program may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases, and it's always a good practice to thoroughly test the program before using it with critical data.
